# Bullwhip-Effect-of-Covid-19

The Bullwhip Effect of Covid-19 is an Economics Honors Thesis at Macalester College in the year of 2020 to 2021. The thesis is advised by Professor Felix Friedt.

## Description

This study investigates the bullwhip effect of Covid-19 on global supply chains from the Chinese perspective. The bullwhip effect refers to the amplification of demand shock along the supply chain, and my baseline estimates show that a 1% increase in foreign new cases (a proxy for foreign demand shock) reduces exports of downstream products and that of upstream industries by 2.1% and 4.5% respectively. The estimates also suggest that whether industries are concentrated or not generates ambiguous effects on exports that vary from different empirical specifications. In addition, a heterogeneity analysis suggests that the bullwhip effect is stronger in regional supply chains among geographically proximate countries and countries that are closely connected in terms of the trade volume. Furthermore, a dynamic analysis shows that the outbreak of Covid-19 in foreign countries causes a lagged import substitution towards Chinese products that reverses the initially negative demand shock. Unlike the initial adverse effect, I find that the lagged import substitution does not amplify along the supply chain, but mostly affects downstream industries.

## Programming Language

Mostly Stata.

## Data Sources

The Chinese exports data is published by the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China (GACC). It records the Chinese export trade value in US dollars at monthly frequency from January 2019 to September 2020 at the Chinese Province-Foreign Country-two digit Harmonized System (HS) commodity level. The full sample consists of 97 commodity classes exported from 31 Chinese provinces to 243 foreign countries.

The Chinese Covid data is published in the monthly reports of China’s National Health Commission and the global Covid data is reported by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Both Chinese and foreign Covid data include the number of confirmed cases and deaths from January to September 2020 at the province/foreign country level (Note that the data from ECDC only includes the statistics for 212 countries).

The upstreamness index data comes from Antràs, Chor, Fally, and Hillberry (2012) who measure the upstreamness index of different industries in the United States and examine the applicability of the index to other countries.
